# CUSTOM Piwik PRO Analytics template for Google Tag Manager

*Important note:* this template used to serve as a fork of the [original template by Piwik PRO](https://github.com/PiwikPRO/analytics-template-for-gtm) with the goal to add ecom functionality and better compatibility.  

The former [pull request](https://github.com/PiwikPRO/analytics-template-for-gtm/pull/1) is closed and instead I contributed directly to a new template version that is [currently in development](https://github.com/PiwikPRO/analytics-template-for-gtm/tree/development) and will hopefully get submitted and published in the *Community Template Gallery* soon. 

## Should I continue to use the fork?
My custom version used to offer some features like (old) ecom hit types. But meanwhile there is even a new ecom version available that is fully integrated into the new official template. So if you do not (for whatever reason) need the old ecom requests, there is simply no reason why this version should be used instead of the regular one (from the [Community Template Gallery](https://tagmanager.google.com/gallery/#/owners/PiwikPRO/templates/analytics-template-for-gtm)).
